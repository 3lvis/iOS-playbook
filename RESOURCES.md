## The new wave

iOS, mainly thanks to Swift, is transitioning to a whole new level. Now you hear more about Functional Programming, Reactive Programming, Immutability and so much more:

- Haskell and Scala are probably some of the most relevant functional languages out there, learning them is embracing *the new wave*

- Immutability: It's much easier to deal with 2 immutable things than 1 mutable. You can pass them around and no one can change them. `Immutability = happy programer life`
