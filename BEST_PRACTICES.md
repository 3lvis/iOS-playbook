# Best practices

## When to use blocks, delegates or data source

### Block
- Asynchronous (For example: networking operations)
- User inputs with multiple options (For example: UIAlertView's YES and NO)
- Data source driven inputs (For example: A table items with action blocks that were defined in the data source)
- Returns many values (For example looking for a field in a collection and returning the field and the indexPath)
- If there’s no tracked state or if state it’s defined in the same method

### Delegate
- Synchronous (For example: buttons actions in views that should perform on their parents)
- Shouldn't return values
- Provides control over performing an action (For example: UITextField's shouldEndEditing)
- User input with one action (For example: buttons actions in views that should perform on their parents)
- If tracked state is shared (if state is stored in a property or a constant)

### Data source
- Returns ONE value

## Deployment

### Semantic Versioning

We support semantic versioning, and it's pretty important that minor releases are backwards compatible otherwise don't feel shy to make it a major version.

When making backwards compatible changes, flag your old APIs as deprecated like this:

```objc
- (NSInteger)foo:(NSInteger)bar __attribute__((deprecated("Use fooWithBar: instead")));
```
