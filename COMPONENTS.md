Every agnostic component (UI control, category, helper, etc) should be created in a separate repository.

Your component should be unit tested and documented.

# Steps to create a category component
- [ ] Create repo
- [ ] Download https://github.com/hyperoslo/pod-template/archive/master.zip
- [ ] Extract files to your empty repo
- [ ] Replace all ocurrences of `<PODNAME>`
- [ ] Rename `PODNAME.podspec`
- [ ] Enable Travis support for your repo in https://travis-ci.org/profile/hyperoslo
- [ ] Share it with the world! You get :cake:
